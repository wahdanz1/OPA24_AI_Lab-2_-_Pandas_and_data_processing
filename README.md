# Lab 2 - Pandas and data processing
### OPA24 @ NBI/Handelsakademin, Gothenburg
This repository is the second lab of my current part-course **AI 1 - Python** of my ongoing education "Object-oriented programming with AI".

### Conclusion
This lab was very helpful in letting me practice using pandas, matplotlib and plotlyexpress. I got to practice both using the libraries/modules, but also to analyze data to try to comprehend relations and definitions. 

After this, I feel more comfortable using these libraries, and I have become aware of a lot of new and useful functions and parameters. I could definitely keep refactoring the code further, but for now I will have to feel happy with what I have accomplished as a Python rookie.
